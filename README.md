### Basic Todo CRUD with PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Express.js

I made this project during my first time learning PostgreSQL with Node.js. It's a basic CRUD application where you can create, read, update, and delete todos using a PostgreSQL database with Node.js and Express.js.

#### How to Run
##### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
##### 2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
    npm install

##### 3. Create an .env file in the root directory of the project, and add your PostgreSQL connection details:
    PGUSER=your_pg_user
    PGHOST=localhost
    PGDATABASE=your_database_name
    PGPASSWORD=your_password
    PGPORT=5432

##### 4. Make sure your PostgreSQL database is installed on your machine.

##### 5. Start the application by running:
  ```bash
  npm start
